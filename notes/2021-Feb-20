Meeting with Tanveer

Fluxing vectors project

Want to derive
- petal to petal variation
- variation in time (by exposure)
- variation across the focal plane (other than explicitly by petal)

Want a data structure PER exposure with a bunch of spectra and
- focal plane x,y
- petal number
- MJD or TAI of exposure
- seeing (PSF)
- airmass
- exposure time, etc. 
- model stellar spectrum
- observed spectrum
- any relevant atmospheric or weather information
- anything else the answer could depend on.
